## Structure

My solutions to various tasks from the class are in [tasks/](../css-practice-tasks/)

The to-do app written in React is in [todo-react-app](../)

Most of my notes from this class have been incorporated into my [learning-html-css](https://github.com/rlivings39/learning-html-css) repo where I worked through MDN tutorials.

## Notes

In VS Code typing `!` and hitting tab will give you templates with Emmet. Look into others.

## Actions

- [x] Read through Maria's 2.9. HTML/CSS tips for great alignment tips
- [ ] React next
- [ ] Do a few of the section 2 projects, maybe
